      <H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>1) Who is the target audience for attendance at the course?</strong></p>
      <p>The target audience is professionals who would like to apply Six Sigma, 
        quality improvement, or statistical skills to their organization and students and professionals who are seeking new employment opportunities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>2) What level of technical background is needed for success in 
        the course?</strong></p>
      <p>Any level of technical background will work (some previous exposure to 
        algebra and statistics would be helpful). We will offer optional review courses after 
        regular classes in order to help everyone achieve the same level of understanding if requested. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong> 3) How much of a time commitment is involved in each of the 
        sessions?</strong></p>
      <p>The sessions will be from 9:00am--Noon, and then from 1pm--5:00pm.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>4) What does the "Green Belt" involve?</strong></p>
      <p>The green belt program is only one week of academic training which culminates 
      in an exam.  This level of certification does not involve a project. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>5) What does the "Brown Belt" involve?</strong></p>
      <p>Brown belt candidates must already have a Six Sigma green belt through Dartmouth or another certifying agency.  There are two further four day sessions required for Brown Belt certification.  The final day of the second Brown Belt session is an exam.  This program was developed at Dartmouth as a way for us to recognize Black Belt candidates after they had completed the academic requirements of the Black Belt, but before they had successfully completed their project. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>6) What does the "Black Belt" involve?</strong></p>
      <p>Black belt candidates must have already passed both the Green Belt and 
      the Brown Belt certification.  At this stage, the candidate must be leading efforts in 
      a Six Sigma initiative at their own place of work (or other similar organization).  </p>
<p>The Black Belt project is quite involved. Briefly, the  candidate must be able to explain Six Sigma philosophies and principles, including supporting systems and tools, (quality, process/continuous improvement, etc.) and must be able to apply them in various business processes throughout an organization. The project culminates in a report on how the professional was able to apply what he has learned to benefit his or her company in a measurable way.
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong>7) How does the Dartmouth program compare with other Six Sigma certification programs?</strong></p>
      <p>The Dartmouth Six Sigma program began in early 2005. While designing our innovative 
      course, we critically evaluated curriculums of 20+ outstanding programs in other parts of the 
      country  and feel that our curriculum rigorously prepares our certification candidates for the challenges they face when they bring what they have learned to their home organizations.    </p>
<p>Our strong curriculum is augmented by our teaching staff.  Instructors include professors from both the engineering and business schools at Dartmouth College, as well as industry leading professionals who have formally and informally been involved in Six Sigma and lean initiatives for many years.  </p>
<p>We feel that if you prepare for Six Sigma certification by completing our course, you are likely to be successful in whatever certification exam you choose to sit.
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p><strong>8) Is there additional information anywhere that speaks to the 
        format, teaching methods and curriculum for the course?</strong></p>
      <p>Please watch our website or contact us at <a href="mailto:SixSigma@Dartmouth.edu">SixSigma@Dartmouth.edu</a> 
      for more information on format, teaching structure, 
        laboratory components, and curriculum outlines. In general, the course will consist of a combination of lectures, 
        laboratory exercises, group work, and discussion. We aim to balance the 
        practical with the theoretical to provide you with tools as well as background 
        to apply them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
