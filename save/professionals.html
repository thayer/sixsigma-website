<p>Enhance your career as a Lean Six Sigma professional through one of our three levels of certification:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#yellow">Yellow Belt</a></li>
	<li><a href="#green">Green Belt</a></li>
	<li><a href="#black">Black Belt</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="yellow" id="yellow"></a><h2>Yellow Belt</h2>
<p class="p-after-h2">This one-day, interactive workshop introduces front-line employees to quality improvement techniques. Participants learn to use a variety of Lean improvement and Six Sigma quality tools under a DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) framework. With Yellow Belt certification, you will add value to any team that aims to improve its company's process. Yellow Belt certification is awarded upon workshop completion.</p>

<p>All Yellow Belt workshops are custom offerings, tailored to meet your company's specific needs and schedule.  <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> to schedule a Yellow Belt workshop.</p>

<a name="green" id="green"></a><h2>Green Belt</h2>
<p class="p-after-h2">This five-day, hands-on workshop is designed for Lean Six Sigma project team members. Participants will become familiar with basic Lean and Six Sigma tools within the context of the DMAIC methodology. Core workshops offer statistical analysis package training (MINITAB or JMP) to conduct and analyze various outputs stemming from experiments in the measurement phase (Statistical Process Control) and the analysis phase (Design of Experiments) in a well-designed Lean Six Sigma project. </p>
<p>Familiarity with college math and statistics will help students adjust to the rigorous work that the course entails. A laptop will be needed for this workshop; participants are required to download at least the trial copy of a statistical analysis package. </p>
<p>To maintain the high standards of Dartmouth Engineering, we require testing at the Green Belt level before granting certification. An open-book and open-notes test is held on the final day of this workshop and is designed to help verify your newly gained knowledge. A score of 70% or greater is necessary to pass the test.</p>
<p>With Green Belt certification, you will be able to manage root cause analysis, process mapping, and a variety of useful process calculations, making an invaluable member of any Lean Six Sigma project team.</p>

<a name="black" id="black"></a><h2>Black Belt</h2>
<p class="p-after-h2">This nine-day workshop is designed for Lean Six Sigma team leaders and expands upon the skill set taught in the Green Belt certification. The coursework includes instruction on modules in practical DMAIC applications, Failure Mode Effects Analysis, Advanced Lean, Advanced DOE, SPC for non-normal distributions, Optimization, Scheduling &amp; Sequencing, Effective and Efficient teamwork strategies as well as a variety of other tools and analysis methodologies. As with each of our workshops, we offer case-based exercises to enhance learning.</p>
<p>A laptop with a functional copy of a statistical analysis package, such as MINITAB, will be needed for this workshop. A final examination will measure your grasp of the theory necessary to be a successful Black Belt. An open-book and open-notes test is held at the culmination of this workshop, where a score of 70% or greater is required to pass the test. Black Belt certification is conferred upon successful completion of this exam and satisfactory review of your Black Belt project by the Lean Six Sigma workshop faculty.</p>
<p>The Black Belt project usually takes three to six months of work and is conducted by individuals or teams at their place of business within a year of completing the coursework. (Alternatively, participants can request to complete two out of three case studies within three months of the classroom work if they are unable to establish a Black Belt project at their company.) Members of the Lean Six Sigma teaching staff will be available as mentors for candidates during this part of the Black Belt certification process.</p>
<p>Participants must have completed or been exempted from the Green Belt program before taking this workshop. </p>
