<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>



<ol class="ol-padding-bottom">

<li><strong>How does the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth program compare with other Lean Six Sigma certification programs?</strong>
<br />Certification in Lean Six Sigma from Thayer ensures that participants have been rigorously tested on their theoretical and practical understandings of Lean and Six Sigma techniques. We take pride in the fact that our coursework requires the most comprehensive understanding of these topics as any we have surveyed since 2005. Our faculty augment our strong curriculum. Instructors include professors from both the engineering and business schools at Dartmouth College, as well as leading industry professionals who have been involved in Six Sigma and Lean initiatives for many years.
</li>

<li><strong>What level of technical background is needed for success in these workshops?</strong>
<br />Some technical background is required for professional participants. Individuals with previous exposure to algebra and statistics generally find the material a bit easier than those who do not. We offer optional review sessions after regular lecture hours in order to help everyone achieve the same level of understanding. Dartmouth students wishing to take the Green Belt workshop must have passed a graduate level statistics course.
</li>

<li><strong>Do I need to take the Green Belt course before I take the Black Belt workshop?</strong>
<br />Generally speaking, yes. Please contact us if you feel you should be exempt from this requirement.
</li>

<li><strong>Who is the target audience for workshops?</strong>
<br />Workshops are designed for professionals who would like to apply Lean Six Sigma tools and concepts (continuous quality improvement though statistical analysis) to their organizations. Our offerings are also applicable to students and professionals who are seeking new employment opportunities.
</li>

<li><strong>Who takes the Yellow Belt certification workshop?</strong>
<br />Yellow Belt certification is for individuals and groups who want a basic understanding of Lean Six Sigma and have the ability to use some of the tools of process improvement. The workshop is ideal for front-line employees and managers who implement a company's basic work.
